                <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a deep love for programming and have been self-teaching myself different programming 
                    languages for years. What started as curiosity has evolved into a true passion for software 
                    development and problem-solving through code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a Bachelor's degree in Network Administration, which has given me a strong foundation 
                    in understanding how systems work together. Beyond networking, I have a particular passion 
                    for learning the ins and outs of video game creation and production. The intersection of 
                    technology, creativity, and interactive storytelling fascinates me, and I'm constantly 
                    exploring new tools and techniques in game development.

                <h2>My Love for Animals & the Outdoors</h2>
                <p>
                    My passion isn't limited to technology—I also have a deep love for animals. I earned an 
                    Associate's degree in Veterinary Technician, which has allowed me to combine my care for 
                    animals with practical medical knowledge. Working with animals has taught me patience, 
                    compassion, and attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it's working in the garden, tending to plants and 
                    watching them grow, or hiking through the woods with my PSA, Cosmo. There's something 
                    incredibly peaceful about being in nature, and Cosmo is always the perfect companion for 
                    any adventure. These moments help me recharge and find balance in life.
                </p>
